# The Bland Framework: A light-weight PHP Framework
* * *

I am not a PHP ninja. Pull at your own (extremely high) risk.

## General Goals for the project:
1. **Loose Coupling**
	* limited or no singletons, globals, static methods, etc.
	* use dependency injection
	* single responsibility principle for classes
2. **High Testability**
	* test suites for every class
	* use PHPUnit for Test-driven Development
3. **Well-Documented**
	* DocBlocks for every class, property, method, and file
	* Follow conventions of PHPDocumentor
